*****Main Project Goal : 

Hey we have project of expense management ecosystem application 

There will be 5 type of users each user have have its own Dashboard and login page end point 

1. Super Admin

Now MIS Real work is to check the Global Expense table , is there Any Discripency or not is any of the entry of any business unit expense entry

-MIS can click on edit & update on global sheet of Any entry & can change or update entry of any particular tool or any entry row 
so to correct any miss inputed entry & save then the entry will be updated in the global sheet of expense or table we say
-MIS can Bulk upload its own maintianed sheet or add new entry by itself manually 
but in bulk upload we will map each column to its defined value to current global sheet when MIS upload a do so, so whatever sheet MIS upload our system will parse 
and map the input values to the corrected global sheet as like column values if something is missing that field will be empty

-Also if MIS month end entry or whatever the count of entries bulk uploaded by mis on our system into global sheets if the bulk entries of mis sheet are same 
with current live global sheet entries like all columns and row of each service value are same 

example  : 

MIS uploaded data  : 

Card No      | Card Assigned To   | Date       | Month     | Status    etc
C002         | Priya Shah         | 10-Feb-25  | Feb-2025  | Active    etc

Global Sheet : 

Card No      | Card Assigned To   | Date       | Month     | Status    etc
C002         | Priya Shah         | 10-Feb-25  | Feb-2025  | Active    etc

if that condition happens then our system will merge the two sheets and show the merged data in the global sheet and in the end of mis dahsboard of global expense sheet it will show data is duplicated from you sheet and now the data is merged and in the gloabl sheet end of row of mis dashboard mis can see the merged signed value that data is dupliacted and merged
and if no duplicate data on uploaded sheet that data will be added in the global sheet and count as accountable and updated in the sheet

Means if both MIS & Global entries all nodes are same our system will understand the entries & understand the entries uploaded by MIS is duplicate so our 
system will say on the end of every entry row to MIS global sheet dashbaord that entry is merged if any entry is duplicated

example  :  this is the example after uploading of bulk sheet by mis and our system already detected the dupliacted entries and marked them merged in end and those entries were new added no previous record are marked as unique system

the mereged and unique marked column will only see by MIS not super admin cause super admin will only see global expense sheet and not the merged and unique column
this mereged and unique columne is generally for data completness for mis cause mis is bulk uploading the entries here ,
also same logic applies for Add new manual entry in MIS dashbaord when making new entry to global expense sheet when mis is do so and making a new entry in new row of global expense sheet
if that entry is already present in global expense sheet then our system will merge and say mereged and if not and if it is new and unique entry with no past not present it will be added and marked as unique 

Every entry has to be unique in its own way a singled dated entry of all same data should a single entry no duplicates are allowed in our system.


MIS :  Mis will also have filters for its global expense sheet/table for consolidated and vast viewing and analytical experience
mis can filter the whole table on the single and combinational filters like filter by data : when filter all selected dates entries will be showing in mis dashboard gloabl expense sheet in mis dashboard
more filters like by month, by card no, , business unit , by status (Active or deactive) marked , or any combinational and all sort of filters possible
and the table/sheet comes by these filters or combination of filters will be shown in mis dashboard of global expense sheet 

example  : filtered : By date , by business unit wytlabs, by status active

**************Service Handler account and dahsboard********************************


Another account is of service handler : service handler is who is using the serivces or on the name of whome the serivces have been purchased,
A serivce handler is who has its name on the global expense table under (tools or serivce handler (user name) ) column where all different different service handler names appears of different different entires and under different different business units

A service handler will have its own dashbaord and a account where service handler can only see the serivces he/she is using and alloted to from the global expense sheet as the service handler name will be on the global sheet.

Service handler can see the serivces aloted to him/her 

serivce handler account can be created by Super admin with all the details and the Business unit admin as well with all the required details 

Now Also serivce handler can click on disable button on every serivce entry he/she is using at the row end    | diable | button 
because if the serivce handler don'nt wanted to continue with that serivce the serivce handler will be click on disable that serivce a condition here is the serivce
handler need to manually cancel the service subscription and then needs to click on the disable button , also when click to disable button a generall ask out by our system will be pop up did you canceled subscription  and if serivce handler click yes and email will be 
triggered to the MIS expense manager with all the details of that serivce and all details and we already talked about that the mis will be having a feature called edit/update gloabl expense sheet entries

what our MIS do if he got the disable request from the serivce handler the mis logged into his account and in global sheet he will search all details that wanted to cancel and mis
will click on edit/update and click the status column row of that particular entry that has to be disable and from drop down that entry will be marked as deactive under status column row and will click on update and that particular entry will be updated gloabally in 
gloabal expense sheet.
